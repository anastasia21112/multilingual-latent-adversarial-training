## Overview
In response to the challenge of hallucinations in the output of LLM due to false or outdated knowledge, **model editing** has received a lot of attention due to its low resource consumption. Previous studies have proposed many effective methods and achieved good results in editing performance. However, these model editing methods often overlooking potential sideeffects on the general abilities of LLMs.

This paper analyze side effects by evaluating four popular editing methods on four LLMs across eight representative task categories.
